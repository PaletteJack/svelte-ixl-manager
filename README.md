## Purpose

Made this as I frequently manage spreadsheets for IXL (adding students and teachers, changing grades, etc.) and wanted a more efficient way of achieving this. Looking at spreadsheets is terrible ðŸ¥².

It performs simple CRUD operations. The hardest part was validating the data that is initially imported via spreadsheets. Will eventually need to optimize the CSV validator but it is working for now. This project has been put on the back burner.. I have other projects I am working on that are taking priority.

Made with Sveltekit, Tailwind, and better-sqlite3.
